- **Mobile**: Full-screen adaptive layout
- **All Devices**: Touch-friendly, keyboard accessible

## Where It Works

âœ… **Landing Page** - Available to help learn basics  
âœ… **Designer Page** - Assists during habitat design  
ðŸ”œ **Easy to add to any page** - Simple integration pattern

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `src/components/UI/AIAssistant.jsx` - Main chat component (420 lines)
2. `src/styles/aiAssistant.css` - Dedicated styles (380 lines)
3. `AI_ASSISTANT_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive documentation

### Modified Files
1. `src/pages/DesignerPage.jsx` - Added AI Assistant integration
2. `src/pages/LandingPage.jsx` - Added AI Assistant integration
3. `src/styles/index.css` - Added FAB button styles

## How to Use

### For Users
1. **Click the blue ðŸ¤– button** in the bottom-right corner
2. **Choose a quick question** or type your own
3. **Get instant answers** about space habitats
4. **Ask follow-up questions** to learn more
5. **Minimize or close** when done

### Example Questions
- "What are noise separation requirements?"
- "Tell me about life support systems"
- "How does ISRU construction work?"
- "What are crew quarter requirements?"
- "Explain radiation protection"

## Knowledge Base Topics

### Module Design
- Crew Quarters, Exercise Module, Greenhouse
- Medical Bay, Airlock, Waste Management
- Storage, Workshop, Communications

### Mission Planning
- Crew Size (4, 6, 10+ astronauts)
- Duration (short, medium, long missions)
- Destinations (Lunar, Mars, ISS)

### Systems & Standards
- Life Support (O2, CO2, water, waste)
- Power Systems (solar, nuclear, batteries)
- Radiation Protection (shielding, storm shelters)
- Pathfinding (clearances, egress routes)
- Zoning (noise/quiet, clean/dirty separation)

### Construction Methods
- Rigid (pre-fabricated, high reliability)
- Inflatable (compact launch, large volume)
- ISRU (local resources, minimal launch mass)

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Pure React**: No external AI APIs required
- **Keyword-Based Matching**: Fast, offline-capable
- **Local State Management**: No Redux needed
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend knowledge base

### Performance
- **Lightweight**: < 1MB total (component + styles)
- **Fast**: Instant responses (500ms delay for UX)
- **No API Calls**: Fully offline
- **Memory Efficient**: Cleans up on close

### Browser Support
âœ… Chrome/Edge  
âœ… Firefox  
âœ… Safari  
âœ… Mobile browsers

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. **GPT Integration** - Connect to OpenAI for advanced conversations
2. **Context Awareness** - Analyze current design and suggest improvements
3. **Visual Aids** - Show diagrams and 3D previews in responses
4. **Voice Interface** - Speech-to-text and text-to-speech
5. **Learning Paths** - Guided tutorials and progress tracking
6. **Multi-language** - Support for international users
