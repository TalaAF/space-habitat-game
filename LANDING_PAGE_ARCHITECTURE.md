# Landing Page Educational Layer - Implementation Guide

## Mission Overview

The landing page serves as **Layer 1: The Mission Briefing** - an immersive, scrollytelling experience that educates users about space habitat design before they enter the interactive Design Lab.

## The Space Habitat Challenge

**NASA's Mission:** Through the Artemis campaign, NASA is returning humans to the Moon to establish a sustained presence. The Moon will serve as a proving ground for technologies that will inform future human missions to Mars.

**User's Challenge:** Create visual layouts for space habitats that support critical functions:
- Waste management
