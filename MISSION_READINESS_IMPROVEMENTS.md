#### Control Center (Command) üñ•

- **Ergonomics**: Restrained position control accessibility
- **Display Clarity**: Critical system display visibility
- **Collaboration**: Multi-crew member workspace
- **System Visibility**: Line of sight to critical operations

#### Workshop üîß

- **Containment**: Floating particle debris collection
- **Work Surfaces**: Robust surfaces and equipment restraints
- **Ventilation**: Debris and fume extraction
- **Power & Data**: Ample tool connection capabilities

### 2. Habitat Layout Principles

#### Zoning Requirements

- **Quiet vs. Noisy Zones**: Separation of incompatible activities
  - Quiet: Living quarters, medical bay
  - Noisy: Galley, exercise, workshop
- **Clean vs. Dirty Zones**: Contamination prevention
  - Clean: Galley, medical, living quarters
  - Dirty: Airlock (dust), workshop

#### Adjacency Requirements

- **Required Adjacencies**:
  - Galley must be adjacent to Storage (wardroom function)
- **Preferred Adjacencies**:
  - Airlock near Workshop and Storage (EVA preparation)
  - Command near Lab (operations oversight)
  - Greenhouse near Galley (food production flow)
  - Medical near Living quarters (emergency access)
- **Avoided Adjacencies**:
  - Exercise away from Living, Medical, Lab (vibration)
  - Workshop away from Medical, Galley (contamination)
  - Airlock away from Galley (dust contamination)

#### Translation Paths

- **Emergency Access**: Maximum 8m distance to critical modules
- **Central Hub**: Galley as social gathering point
- **Path Clearance**: Minimum 1.2m corridor width
- **Dead-end Minimization**: Avoid trapped configurations

### 3. Enhanced Validation System

#### Four-Tier Assessment

1. **Mass Budget (20% weight)**: Launch vehicle capacity constraints
2. **Power & Life Support (25% weight)**: Crew survival systems
3. **Module Qualities (30% weight)**: Individual module functionality
4. **Habitat Layout (25% weight)**: Overall design efficiency

#### Detailed Issue Reporting

- **Critical Issues**: Must be resolved before mission launch
- **Warnings**: Impact crew comfort and efficiency
- **Recommendations**: Specific guidance for improvements

#### Interactive Validation Modal

- **Overview Tab**: Summary of all issues and score breakdown
- **Module Qualities Tab**: Detailed per-module quality assessments
- **Habitat Layout Tab**: Zoning, adjacency, and path validation
- **Basic Requirements Tab**: Legacy mass, power, volume checks

### 4. Problem Identification System

The new system identifies specific problems such as:

#### Privacy Issues

- "Privacy compromised by nearby noisy modules: Exercise Module, Workshop"
- "Living quarters completely surrounded - inadequate ventilation circulation"

#### Contamination Risks

- "Lab contamination risk from nearby dirty modules: Airlock, Workshop"
- "Airlock contamination risk to Galley (2.1m)"

#### Vibration Problems

- "Exercise vibrations will interfere with: Laboratory, Sleep Pod"

#### Adjacency Violations

- "Galley must be adjacent to Storage to create functional wardroom/dining area"
- "Airlock needs nearby Workshop and Storage for EVA suit servicing"

#### Emergency Access Issues

- "Medical Bay too far from crew quarters for emergency access"
- "Galley (social hub) is not centrally located for easy crew access"

## Technical Implementation

### New Functions

- `validateModuleQualities()`: Comprehensive module-specific validation
- `validateHabitatLayout()`: Layout principle enforcement
- `validateZoning()`: Noise and contamination separation
- `validateAdjacency()`: Required and avoided adjacencies
- `validateTranslationPaths()`: Emergency access and flow validation

### Enhanced UI Components

- **ValidationModal**: Tabbed interface with detailed problem reporting
- **CSS Enhancements**: Visual indicators for different issue severities
- **Interactive Navigation**: Easy switching between assessment areas

## Benefits

1. **Realistic Space Habitat Design**: Based on actual NASA design principles
2. **Specific Problem Identification**: Clear guidance on what needs fixing
3. **Educational Value**: Teaches real space habitat design constraints
4. **Improved User Experience**: Visual, tabbed interface with clear feedback
5. **Comprehensive Assessment**: Multi-faceted evaluation beyond basic requirements

## Usage

Players now receive detailed feedback about their habitat designs, including:

- Why specific module placements are problematic
- What qualities each module should have in a real space environment
- How to arrange modules for optimal crew safety and efficiency
- Specific recommendations for design improvements

The system maintains backward compatibility while providing much more detailed and educational feedback about space habitat design principles.
