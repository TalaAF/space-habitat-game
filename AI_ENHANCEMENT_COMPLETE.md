## 🧠 Intelligence Features

### Pattern Recognition
- **Greeting** → Friendly welcome
- **How** question → "Here's how that works..."
- **Why** question → "Great question! Here's why..."
- **What** question → "Let me explain..."
- **Comparison** → "Here's a comparison..."
- **Thanks** → "You're welcome! ..."
- **Goodbye** → "Farewell! ..."

### Smart Matching
Input: "sleep area" → Finds: crew quarters
Input: "food growing" → Finds: greenhouse
Input: "breathing" → Finds: life support
Input: "protect from rad" → Finds: radiation

### Related Topics
After every answer:
```
"💡 Related topics you might find interesting:
• crew quarters
• zoning  
• safety"
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Step 1: Open the App
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/space-habitat-game/`

### Step 2: Click 🤖 Button
Bottom-right corner

### Step 3: Start Chatting!
Try any of these:
- "Hi! I need help designing a Mars habitat"
- "How does radiation protection work?"
- "What's the difference between rigid and inflatable modules?"
- "Thanks!"

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Talk Naturally
Don't use keywords, just ask:
- ❌ "crew quarter specification"
- ✅ "How big should bedrooms be?"

### Tip 2: Ask Follow-ups
The AI understands context:
```
"Tell me about radiation"
"What about on Mars?"  ← Knows you mean Mars radiation
"How do I protect against it?"  ← Still in context
```

### Tip 3: Try Different Formats
- "Explain simply"
- "Compare in detail"
- "Give me step-by-step instructions"
- "Show calculations"

### Tip 4: Use Question Words
- **How** - for processes
- **Why** - for reasoning
- **What** - for definitions
- **Compare** - for differences
- **Recommend** - for suggestions
