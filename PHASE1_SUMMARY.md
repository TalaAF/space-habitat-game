## 🗂️ Firestore Data Structure

### Collection: `public_designs`

Each document represents a published habitat design:

```javascript
{
  designName: "String",           // e.g., "Ares I Lunar Outpost"
  creatorName: "String",          // e.g., "Commander Alex"
  thumbnail: "String",            // Base64 JPEG for preview
  missionParams: {
    crewSize: Number,             // e.g., 4
    destination: "String",        // 'lunar', 'mars', 'orbit'
    duration: "String",           // 'short', 'medium', 'long'
    constructionType: "String"    // 'rigid', 'inflatable', 'isru'
  },
  modules: [
    {
      type: "String",             // 'living', 'lab', 'storage', etc.
      position: {
        x: Number,
        y: Number,
        z: Number
      }
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Timestamp            // Server timestamp for sorting
}
```

## 🌐 Application Routes

The application now supports the following routes:

1. **`/`** - Landing page (home)
2. **`/designer`** - Habitat designer (existing)
3. **`/hub`** - Community hub (new)

### Navigation Features:
- Elegant navigation bar (top-right corner)
- Active route highlighting
- Smooth hover effects
- Responsive design
- Hidden on landing page for clean first impression

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### For You (Developer):

1. **Configure Firebase:**
   - Follow instructions in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md`
   - Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com/
   - Copy configuration to `src/firebase.js`
   - Set up Firestore database
   - Apply security rules

2. **Test the Application:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/space-habitat-game/
   - Test all three routes (/, /designer, /hub)
   - Verify navigation works smoothly

3. **Verify Firebase Connection:**
   - Open browser console
   - Look for any Firebase initialization errors
   - Should see no errors if configured correctly

## 🎨 Community Hub Features (Current)

The Community Hub page currently displays:
- Professional gradient background matching your design system
- Header with "Community Hub" title
- Navigation back to designer
- Empty state message (no designs yet)
- Call-to-action to create first design
- Footer with phase information

## 📋 Next Steps - Phase 2 Preview

Phase 2 will implement:
1. **Publish to Community Feature**
   - "Share Design" button in designer
   - Modal for design name and creator name input
   - Screenshot capture for thumbnail
   - Save to Firestore functionality

2. **Gallery Display**
   - Fetch designs from Firestore
   - Grid layout of design cards
   - Thumbnail previews
   - Mission parameters display

3. **Basic Filtering**
   - Filter by destination
   - Filter by crew size
   - Sort by date (newest first)

## 🔒 Security Notes

**Current Setup (Development):**
- Firestore rules allow all reads and writes
- No authentication required
- ⚠️ **NOT suitable for production**

**Future Production Setup:**
- User authentication required for publishing
- Users can only edit/delete their own designs
- Public read access maintained for browsing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If navigation doesn't work:
- Clear browser cache
- Ensure React Router is properly installed
- Check browser console for errors

### If Firebase errors appear:
- Verify configuration in `src/firebase.js`
- Check Firebase Console for project status
- Ensure Firestore is enabled
- Verify security rules are published

### Common Firebase Errors:
- **"Firebase: No Firebase App"** - Configuration not imported
- **"Missing permissions"** - Security rules not published
- **"Invalid API key"** - Check configuration values
