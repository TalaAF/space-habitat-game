2. Try zooming (scroll wheel)
3. Try panning (right-click + drag)
4. Click "Mission Readiness Analysis"
5. Try adding a new module
6. Try moving an existing module

### Expected Behavior:

## Test 6: Multiple Clones

### Steps:
1. Navigate back to Community Hub (click nav link)
2. Clone a **different** design
3. Verify previous cloned design is replaced
4. Repeat for 2-3 different designs

### Expected Behavior:
- Each clone replaces the previous one
- No data from previous clones remains
- State resets completely each time
- All designs load correctly

### ✅ Success Criteria:
- [ ] Can clone multiple designs sequentially
- [ ] No state contamination
- [ ] Each design loads fresh

## Test 7: Edge Cases

### Test 7a: Clone with No Modules
**Setup**: Publish an empty design (if possible) or mock one
- Should load with mission params but no modules
- Should not crash

### Test 7b: Clone with Many Modules
**Setup**: Publish a design with 10+ modules
- All modules should load
- Performance should be acceptable (< 500ms)

### Test 7c: Rapid Clicking
**Setup**: Click "Clone & Explore" rapidly multiple times
- Should not cause errors
- Only one navigation should occur
- State should not corrupt

### Test 7d: Clone, Modify, Clone Again
**Setup**: Clone design → Modify it → Clone another design
- Previous modifications should be lost (expected)
- New design should load clean

### ✅ Success Criteria:
- [ ] Empty designs don't crash
- [ ] Large designs load correctly
- [ ] Rapid clicks handled gracefully
- [ ] Modifications don't persist across clones

## Test 8: Browser Console Health Check

### Check for:
❌ **Bad Signs** (should NOT see):
- Red error messages
- "Cannot read property" errors
- "Undefined is not a function"
- React warnings about keys
- State update warnings

✅ **Good Signs** (should see):
- Blue/purple info logs with emojis
- Structured debug output
- "✅ Success" messages
- Clear operation flow

---

## Test 9: Network Tab (Optional)

### Steps:
1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Clone a design
3. Watch for requests

### Expected:
- **Mock Mode**: No Firebase network requests
- **Real Firebase**: Should see Firestore API calls
- No failed requests (status 200 OK)
- Fast response times (< 500ms)

---

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: "useAppContext must be used within an AppContextProvider"

**Cause**: AppContextProvider not wrapping components
**Fix**: Check `src/App.jsx` - ensure `<AppContextProvider>` wraps `<BrowserRouter>`

---

### Issue: Design doesn't load after clicking Clone

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check console for error messages
2. Verify `🎯 AppContext: Design queued for loading` appears
3. Check if `designToLoad` is null
4. Verify `useEffect` is triggered in DesignerPage

**Common Causes**:
- AppContext not imported correctly
- useEffect dependencies missing
- clearDesignToLoad called too early

---

### Issue: Modules load but positions are wrong

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Check if module positions are in the design data
2. Verify `position: { x, y, z }` structure
3. Check if floors are preserved

**Common Causes**:
- Position data not saved during publish
- Floor height calculation issues
- Module scale issues

---

### Issue: Previous design data persists after clone

**Debugging Steps**:
1. Verify `clearModules()` is called
2. Check if `setModules()` is overwriting correctly
3. Ensure `clearDesignToLoad()` is called

**Common Causes**:
- State cleanup not complete
- useEffect running out of order
- Async timing issues

---

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Timings:
- **Clone Button Click → Navigation**: < 50ms
- **Navigation → useEffect Trigger**: < 10ms
- **State Clear**: < 20ms
- **Module Loading**: < 100ms
- **Total Clone-to-Render**: < 200ms

### How to Measure:
```javascript
// Add to DesignerPage useEffect:
const startTime = performance.now();
// ... loading logic ...
const endTime = performance.now();
console.log(`⏱️ Design loaded in ${endTime - startTime}ms`);
```
